# YouXiang
## Brief introduction
This is a shopping website project developed by me when studying website design. It is similar to Taobao, and it is a C2C shopping website. We have designed comprehensive functions in it, which can realize the whole process of users' online shopping (except logistics services), such as purchasing goods, finding goods and selling goods.
## Technical realization
- For the front-end interface design of the website, we drew lessons from many different websites, and finally designed this appearance.
- We used php language to write back-end, rented a cloud server, and transferred all files and databases to the cloud.
